'Xilinx_max_power' project


designed for Digilent Arty-Z7020 board
based on ZINQ-7000 series SOC, part number xc7z020clg400-1
but can be used for any modern Xilinx FPGA or SOC chip


THIS CODE CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE FOR YOUR FPGA, POWER COMPONENTS, OR
ENTIRE DEVICE. PLEASE USE IT WITH CAUTION


- Use Xilinx power estimator (XPE) tool first. It will estimate currents
and dissipated heat results.
- Make sure you dont overload power system of your device. FPGA will refuse
to boot up if VCCINT power rail voltage got depleted. See

- Control temperatures of FPGA chip and power supply chains during the test.
- On Ultarscale chips, use SYSMON for monitoring.
- Dont exceed recommended FPGA Tj. Additional active cooling can be beneficial.
- Increase load iteratively.

// 1. Loading power by SRLs (shift registers based on LUTs)
// The simplest way to load Xilinx FPGA is to infer SRL16 or SRL32  primitives

// 2. Loading power by integrated block RAM blocks

// 3. Loading power by registers
// Dont use this feature untill you cant drain enough power by previous options
// because this step takes A LOT of time to synthesize and implement
